              My name is Wenwen and I was born in China. I lived in China
              for 24 years and spent five years on my medical education. During
              my last year of medical school, I did my clinical rotations in
              hospitals both in China and Singapore.

              In 2018, I moved to the United States and attended the University
              of Utah. I graduated with a masterâ€™s degree of Public Health in
              2020. After that, I worked as a data quality specialist at the
              Utah Department of Health for one year.
